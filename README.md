Matrix completion aims to reconstruct a complete matrix from a subset of observed entries, typically under a low-rank assumption. We focus on the Frank--Wolfe (FW) algorithm and its pairwise variant (PFW). FW and PFW are implemented with four step-size strategies and evaluated on the MovieLens-100k and X-Wines datasets.
